# Master thesis tracking code
The folders in the repository contain the files used in my master's thesis for tracking photons in different simulation setups

The tracking code was made with Fortran 77, and all .f files contain tracking code

.inp files are the input files where all the cards were determined for builiding the simulation setups
(These files contain the number of primary photons used, and here they are not always consistent with the primary photons used in the simulation)
(It is the number in the thesis that is correct)

Sourcev01.f file is the fortran file used for initializing the spectrum

66kV_2Al.txt is the spectrum provided for the source file
