# Master thesis tracking code
The folders in the repository contain the files used in my master's thesis for tracking photons in different simulation setups

The tracking code was made with Fortran 77, and all .f files contain tracking code

inp files are the input files where all the cards were determined for setting up the simulation

Sourcev01.f file is the fortran file used for initializing the spectrum

66kV_2Al.txt is the spectrum provided for the source file
