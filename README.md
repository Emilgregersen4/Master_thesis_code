# Master thesis tracking code
The code and files mentioned here were all used in my master's thesis for tracking photons in different simulation setups
The tracking code was made with Fortran 77, and all files with .f points to tracking code
inp files are the input files where all the cards were determined for a set simulation

### PMMA-phantom
Interactions happening inside the phantom were registered

Input file: jfjfjjf

Tracking code: jfjfjfjf


### CT-image/Patient
Interactions happening inside the patient were registered

Input file:

Tracking code:

### Operator
Crossing points into the operator and fluence was registered

Input file:

Tracking code:
